Product Information and Vision:
	Air Quality Measurement Software for multi-purpose drone applications.
	Programmed STM32F103 with HAL Libraries. 
	Unlike common modules, this software allows user to communicate directly with the processor unit through user's cellphone.
	Software has the ability to analyze PPM Quantity of volatile organic compounds such as SO2 , CO2, NH3, and CO. 

Format :

	For researches who trying to analyze volatile organic compounds levels in wide areas, Air Quality Measurement Module Project
	is be a software that compitable with drones, that could prevent tremendous time loss.
	Also for gardeners/farmers who are in need of observing different gas levels in their field/farm, this product
	could be helpful in future with simple usage through cellphone.
